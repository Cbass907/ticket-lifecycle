So, the beginning of the ticket lifestyle would be the end user submitting the ticket. In this scenario, the end user (Karen, in this case) is a bank teller that is having issues accessing the online banking system portal. I intentionally put the help topic as general inquiry to simulate an extra potential oversite on the agent side (as far as escalation goes).

Logging in as agent John in the support group, this is how the ticket was presented. There were a few issues to address: the priority needed to be changed to emergency (a banking system being down requires immediate attention), the SLA needed to be changed to Sev-A (the highest priority SLA), and the help topic needed to be changed from general inquiry to business critical outage. After doing all this, I escalated the ticket from John to Jane, while changing the department from support to Sysadmin (Janes' role).
